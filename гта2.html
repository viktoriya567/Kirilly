            <tr><th colspan="6"><p class="text4">Grand Theft Auto V</p><div class="text5">Grand Theft Auto V is an open-world action-adventure multiplatform computer game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. The game was originally released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game consoles in 2013, re-released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2014, and for Windows PCs in 2015. It is the fifteenth game in the Grand Theft Auto series and the next major game after Grand Theft Auto IV, released in 2008. In Russia and the CIS, the publisher of Grand Theft Auto V is 1C-SoftKlab.</div>
                <div class="text5">The game takes place in the fictional state of San Andreas, the prototype of which was Southern California. The story in single-player mode is built around the adventures of three robbers, arranging increasingly daring robberies and opposing both organized crime and law enforcement agencies. During the game, the player controls the selected character in first-or third-person mode; the character can freely move around the vast world of the game on foot, as well as by car and other means of transport. A special feature of Grand Theft Auto V compared to other games in the series is the ability to switch between characters at any time, both during the execution of tasks and outside of them. Many of the game's tasks involve robberies and carjackings, while the player character can participate in shootouts and chases. Grand Theft Auto Online is a built-in online multiplayer mode that supports up to 30 players at a time — both cooperative and competitive tasks are offered for them.</div>
                <div class="text5">Developers from Rockstar Games said that at the time of the release of GTA V is their largest and most ambitious project with the largest open game world created by them. GTA V is not only the most expensive game in terms of development and marketing costs in history, but also one of the most popular — as of 2021, its total sales on all platforms exceed (English)Russian. 135 million copies, second only to the sales of Minecraft.</div>
