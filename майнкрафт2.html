            <tr><th colspan="6"><p class="text4">Minecraft</p><div class="text5">Minecraft is an indie computer game in the sandbox genre, originally created by Swedish programmer Markus Persson and released by his company Mojang AB. Persson published the initial version of the game in 2009; at the end of 2011, a stable version for Microsoft Windows PCs was released, distributed through the official website. In the following years, Minecraft was ported to Linux and macOS for personal computers; to Android, iOS, and Windows Phone for mobile devices; to PlayStation 4, Vita, VR, Xbox One, Nintendo 3DS, Switch, and Wii U game consoles. In 2014, Microsoft acquired the rights to Minecraft along with Mojang AB for $ 2.5 billion. Studio 4J (English)Russian. ported the game to video game consoles, and Xbox Game Studios developed a multiplatform version of Minecraft and a special edition of the game for educational institutions.</div>
                <div class="text5">Minecraft has received universal recognition among the gaming press and many awards. Critics highlighted such main advantages as replayability, minimalistic design, dynamic soundtrack and greater creative freedom, limited only by the imagination of the player; they considered the disadvantages to be the presence of unfinished items and difficulties with creating a network game, as well as the lack of a learning mode in the game. The developers eliminated these shortcomings in the following years. As of summer 2020, more than 200 million copies have been sold across all platforms, making Minecraft the best-selling game in history, and 132 million players have launched the game at least once a month. In the popularization and commercial success of Minecraft, a large role was played by user-generated content, including videos distributed through YouTube, and many third-party modifications. Today, Minecraft is an entire franchise, including, in addition to the main game, such games as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Earth and Minecraft Dungeons.</div>
                <div class="text5">Persson wrote Minecraft in Java using the LWJGL graphical output library, drawing ideas from games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and Infiniminer . Minecraft provides the player with a procedurally generated and modifiable three-dimensional world consisting entirely of cubes — it can be freely rebuilt, creating complex structures from these cubes — this feature makes the game similar to various constructors, such as LEGO.</div>
