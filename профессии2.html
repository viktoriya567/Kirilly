            <tr><th colspan="6"><p class="text4">Gaming industry professions</p><p class="text4">Programmer</p><div class="text5">Today, programmers are the new professional elite of the 21st century. Programmers are needed by everyone and everywhere, and they get enough. If we talk about their role as game devs, then this is the most flexible layer in the professions of the gaming industry. They write in different languages for different systems, thus performing certain tasks. And the flexibility is that if you can walk in one language, it is much easier to find a place for yourself than to relearn to write in another language.</div>
                <p class="text4">Artist</p>
                <div class="text5">Artists are also needed on projects, but there is a problem in finding employment for this profession. If programmers can be described by words like "A specialist in C++ with experience in Unreal", then the artist's main task is to draw so that the visual style fits the project. If it doesn't fit, I don't think you'll get anything. A test task of the type "draw us this" and a portfolio are required.</div>
                <p class="text4">Game Designer</p>
                <div class="text5">The most common profession in the gaming industry and the most famous among the inhabitants. It is a paradox, but given such fame, many people do not understand what a game designer does at all. In the minds of most game designers – this is such lazy people sitting in a chair and thinking: "Hmm, and I will make the game look like a mixture of Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassins' Creed and The Sims, and then add the battle royale... I'm a genius! Where is my salary?". It's not that simple. Often, the game designer is engaged in creating basic mechanics, which often do not work and they have to be done again. And secondly, it designs the levels (their paths) and the geometry of everything.</div>
                <p class="text4">Producer</p>
                <div class="text5">Here, as in the case of a game designer, you must be able to do everything a little: and promote the game, and advertise, and create it. If you have the commitment to complete tasks, knowledge of the game, as well as common sense – then you can try to start with an assistant producer. It's your responsibility to support the project and help everyone. The more you know how to take responsibility and perform tasks of a different nature, the more likely you are to get into this position.</div>
                <p class="text4">Tester</p>
                <div class="text5">This profession belongs to a number of "basic" ones. It stands on the edge between those involved in development and the general professions in the studio, such as analysts, lawyers, accountants, etc. Testers, like beta testers, are responsible for checking the quality of the product. The work is very difficult and consists of the fact that you go through the game or level all day for a certain amount of time.</div>
